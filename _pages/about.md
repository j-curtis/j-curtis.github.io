Hello! My name is Jon, I am currently a postdoc studying quantum condensed matter physics at UCLA. 
I am particularly interested in how to use quantum and classical light to better understand and control complex quantum materials.
Before coming to UCLA, I was a postdoc at Harvard University.
I earned my Ph.D. at University of Maryland, College Park in August, 2020 under the advisement of Prof. Victor Galitski.

In addition to physics, I enjoy running, exercise, travel, drinking coffee, cooking, playing music, and learning new things.
I am always excited to meet new people, so please reach out if you have any questions or comments!
